Find EPSG Coordinate Reference Systems that match your bounds and criteria

**Status**: *Half-baked Idea*

## Goals
Simple command line interface to search the EPSG database for suitable Projected Coordinate Reference Systems based on

* Bounding box
* Geographic Scope (global vs local projections)
* Projection properties (conformal, equal area, azimuthal, etc.)
* Government and Agency Standards for a region

## TODO

Everything. At this point the demo script just does a hardcoded bbox search.
